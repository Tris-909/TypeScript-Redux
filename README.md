# How to do this tutorial ? 
- You can create another react-typescript from your local machine then follow the tutorial on Dev.TO or you can choose to fork this commit. Adding more reducer and actionCreators to it then create a pull request. I will see and merge this. :> Both works fine. But I recommend you to create your own because you will have to go thourgh setting up from scratch and that give you a better understanding.
